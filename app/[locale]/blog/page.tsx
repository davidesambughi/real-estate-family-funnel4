            "Choosing an international school in Portugal is one of the most consequential decisions expat families make — and one of the most stressful. With four major international schools within 45 minutes of Lisbon, each with different curricula, admission processes, and cultures, the choice is far from obvious.",

                body: "The most common mistake is choosing a school based on reputation alone without considering where your children will study next. If you plan to return to the UK, St. Julian's British curriculum (IGCSEs + IB Diploma) maintains the smoothest transition. If you are American or plan to apply to US universities, CAISL or TASIS Portugal's American curriculum is a natural fit. For maximum flexibility, the IB Diploma — offered by all four leading schools — is universally recognised.",

Registration fees (€1,000–3,000 one-time), transport, uniforms, and extra-curricular activities typically add 15–25% to the headline fee. At St. Julian's, for example, families frequently budget €20,000–22,000 all-in versus the advertised €16,000–26,000 range. Ask every school for a full-cost breakdown before comparing.",

The difference between a school's marketing materials and its actual atmosphere can be significant. Request a shadow day — where your child attends classes for a full morning — before signing any enrolment contract. Acceptance rates as low as 8% (St. Julian's) mean you should apply to 2–3 schools simultaneously.",

With the largest concentration of expats in Portugal, it has English-language parent WhatsApp groups, international sports leagues, and a weekly expat meetup scene. Estoril is quieter, more residential, and more Portuguese in flavour — which some families prefer once they have settled and want to integrate more deeply.",

The Cascais Line train runs through both, but Carcavelos station is directly served — meaning there is no school bus dependency if you live centrally. Cascais town centre is 10 minutes further by car than Estoril on the morning school run.",

For families with teenagers who are settled or want to immerse in Portuguese culture, and who value being slightly quieter: choose Estoril.
