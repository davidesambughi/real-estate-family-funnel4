/**
 * Root layout — exists solely to provide metadataBase globally.
 *
 * WHY: Next.js resolves relative OG image URLs (from app/opengraph-image.tsx)
 * against metadataBase. Without this root layout, Next.js falls back to
 * http://localhost:3000 and emits a build warning for every page.
 *
 * The html/body structure and locale providers live in app/[locale]/layout.tsx.
 * This layout just passes children through.
