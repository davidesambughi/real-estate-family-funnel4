## SPRINT 1 — Immediate (unblocked, do now)

These tasks can be started today with no external dependencies.

### Quick Bug Fixes (~30 min total) → **Dev B**
> Good first tasks to get familiar with the codebase.

| # | Task | File | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B7 | Fix `extractRegion`: `loc.includes("set")` is too generic — change to `loc.includes("setúbal") \|\| loc.includes("setubal")` | `components/SchoolsList.tsx:71` | 5 min | ❌ **🅱** |
| B9 | Add scroll-to-top on pagination change in SchoolDirectory | `components/SchoolDirectory.tsx` (pagination handler) | 10 min | ❌ **🅱** |
| B10 | Replace `<dl>` with `<div>` in mini-card key facts (semantic HTML) | `components/SchoolDirectory.tsx:193` | 5 min | ❌ **🅱** |
| B-quiz-ui | Fix "Your Results" hardcoded EN in QuizResult — use `t.resultsTitle` prop instead | `components/features/quiz/QuizResult.tsx:39` | 5 min | ❌ **🅱** |
| B-faq-sf | Add missing 3rd FAQ to FAQPage schema in school-finder (schema has 2 items, HTML renders 3) | `app/[locale]/school-finder/page.tsx:69-92` | 10 min | ❌ **🅱** |

---

### Google Maps Embed → **Dev B**

**Task:** Replace the current "Open in Maps" link stub in `SchoolMap.tsx` and `NeighborhoodMap.tsx` with a real Google Maps iframe embed.

**Details:**
- Use the free Google Maps embed URL (no API key): `https://maps.google.com/maps?q={lat},{lng}&output=embed`
- The iframe should show the school/neighborhood location
- Keep the "Open in Maps" external link below the iframe as a fallback
- Fix B5 at the same time: i18n the "Open in Maps" / "Explore on Maps" label text and the amenity labels (Schools/Cafés/Parks)

**Files to edit:**
- `components/features/SchoolMap.tsx`
- `components/features/NeighborhoodMap.tsx`

**Effort:** ~1h | **Status:** ❌ **🅱**

---

### Neighborhood Filters + Pagination → **Dev B**

**Task:** Add client-side filters and pagination to `NeighborhoodsList.tsx`, mirroring the exact pattern used in `SchoolDirectory.tsx`.

**Details:**
1. Create `components/NeighborhoodDirectory.tsx` as a `"use client"` component (same pattern as `SchoolDirectory.tsx`)
2. Define a minimal `NeighborhoodDirectoryItem` serialized type (slug, name, location, region, pricing tier, family score, vibe)
3. Filters to implement: region (Lisbon / Porto / Algarve / Other), price tier (budget / mid / premium), family score (filter by min score)
4. Pagination: 12 per page, with scroll-to-top on page change
5. Mini-card: neighborhood name, vibe one-liner, region, price tier badge, family score

**Reference:** Read `components/SchoolDirectory.tsx` in full before starting — replicate the exact same architecture.

**Files to create/edit:**
- `components/NeighborhoodDirectory.tsx` (new)
- `components/NeighborhoodsList.tsx` (add pass-through to NeighborhoodDirectory)

**Effort:** ~3h | **Status:** ❌ **🅱**

---

### ContactBtn Fix (school + neighborhood detail pages) → **Dev B**

**Task:** The "Contact" button in school detail pages is a dead `<Button>` with no action. Wire it to open the contact form or scroll to it.

**Details:**
- The contact form is in `components/form.tsx`
- Options: (a) scroll to form section if form is on same page, or (b) link to `/#quiz` with a contact query param, or (c) open a dialog with the form inside
- Apply the same fix to neighborhood detail pages
- **Only do this after `WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` is configured** (otherwise form submits silently fail)

**Files to edit:**
- `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx:149`
- `app/[locale]/neighborhoods/[slug]/page.tsx` (similar button)

**Effort:** ~1h | **Blocker:** WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY must be set first | **Status:** ❌ **🅱**

---

## SPRINT 1 — Immediate → **Dev A**

### Infrastructure Setup

| Task | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://trustfamily.com` to Vercel env vars | Without this, all JSON-LD URLs are wrong in production | ❌ **🅰** |
| Configure custom domain `trustfamily.com` on Vercel | Verify DNS + SSL | ❌ **🅰** |
| Add `WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` to Vercel + `.env.local` | Get from web3forms.com using agency email | ⏳ **🅰** |

---

### Per-School and Per-Neighborhood Images → **Dev A**

**Task:** Add individual images for the 4 curated schools and 5 curated neighborhoods. Currently all school/neighborhood pages share a single generic image (`schools-img.jpg` / `neighborhoods-img.jpg`).

**Details:**
- Source or create 4 school images + 5 neighborhood images (can be stock, editorial, or illustrative)
- Place in `public/` (e.g., `public/schools/st-julians.jpg`, `public/neighborhoods/cascais.jpg`)
- Add an `image` field to the curated school/neighborhood entries in `lib/data/schools.ts` and `lib/data/neighborhoods.ts`
- Update detail pages to use `school.image ?? "/schools-img.jpg"` (keep fallback)

**Files to edit:**
- `lib/data/schools.ts` (4 curated entries)
- `lib/data/neighborhoods.ts` (5 curated entries)
- `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` (use per-school image)
- `app/[locale]/neighborhoods/[slug]/page.tsx` (use per-neighborhood image)

**Effort:** ~2h (image sourcing) + 1h (code) | **Status:** ❌ **🅰**

## SPRINT 2 — Waiting on New School JSON (Dev A leads, Dev B supports)

> These tasks are blocked until the enriched school JSON arrives from the scraper project.
> Expected data: `description`, `admission_process`, `language_support`, `extracurricular_activities`, `transport` for ~61 schools (TIER A).

### Update School Type + Data Pipeline → **Dev A**

| Step | Task | File |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read new JSON structure, identify new/removed fields | `lib/data/raw/schools-database.json` (to be replaced) |
| 2 | Update `School` type with new fields | `lib/types.ts` |
| 3 | Update `importedSchools` mapping in data file | `lib/data/schools.ts` |
| 4 | Update `buildAutoDescription` (or remove for TIER A, keep for TIER B) | `lib/data/schools.ts` |
| 5 | Update `normalizeCurriculum` if new curriculum types appear | `components/SchoolsList.tsx` |
| 6 | Update `extractRegion` if `location.city` coverage improves (fix B6) | `components/SchoolsList.tsx` |
| 7 | Re-verify bugs B8 (fees contact filter) and B11 (curriculum "Other") | `components/SchoolDirectory.tsx`, `SchoolsList.tsx` |

**Effort:** ~4h | **Status:** ⏳ **🅰**

### Update School Detail Page for New Sections → **Dev B** (after Dev A finishes type updates)

| Step | Task | File |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add `admission_process` section to school detail page (TIER A only, conditional) | `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| 2 | Add `extracurricular_activities` section (TIER A only, conditional) | `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| 3 | Add `language_support` to sidebar (all tiers, conditional) | `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| 4 | Add `transport` section (TIER A only, conditional) | `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| 5 | Replace `buildAutoDescription` text with real `description` for TIER A schools | `app/[locale]/schools/[slug]/page.tsx` |

**Effort:** ~3h | **Blocker:** Dev A must finish type updates first | **Status:** ⏳ **🅱**

## SPRINT 3 — Pre-Launch Smoke Test (both)

| # | Check | Who |

| 3 | All school detail pages load without 500 errors (77 pages) | 🅱 (script or manual spot-check) |
| 4 | All neighborhood detail pages load without 500 errors (64 pages) | 🅱 (spot-check) |
| 5 | Filters + pagination on school directory work correctly | 🅱 |
| 6 | Filters + pagination on neighborhood directory work correctly (after Sprint 1) | 🅱 |
| 7 | Hreflang + canonical correct in page source (check 3-4 pages) | 🅰 |
| 8 | JSON-LD schemas valid — paste homepage + 1 school detail into [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) | 🅰 |
| 9 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` set on Vercel → confirm JSON-LD URLs use `trustfamily.com` in production | 🅰 |
| 10 | `npm run build` completes with zero TypeScript errors | 🅰 + 🅱 |
